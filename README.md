Redesigned and Added Validation to Contact Form
Contact Form.
The main problem with the contact form is its validation.

For the Name input – the user can input numbers and it would still be submitted. Also there is no character limits to be submitted.
Post code- has no required character limits.
Email Input – No required number imputs.
Contact Telephone – Allows words to be entered and submitted.
Subject – No required character limits
Message – No required character limits.

How will I improve it?
By adding proper validation to ensure proper/correct information is entered in the form
