<h3>Redesigned and Added Validation to Contact Form</h3>



<h4>What is wrong with the component you chose? </h4>

The main problem with the contact form is its validation.

For the Name input – the user can input numbers and it would still be submitted. Also there is no character limits to be submitted.

Email Input – No required number inputs.

Contact Telephone – Allows words to be entered and submitted.

Subject – No required character limits

Message – No required character limits.

 <h4>How will I improve it?</h4>

By adding proper validation to ensure proper/correct information is entered in the form.

The problems listed above were addressed and made funtional.


<h4>Given more time what would you further improve? </h4>
Redesigning the blog section - to make it more interactive.
